  message: <html>a and b are defined outside of the function and are therefore considered
    global. e is defined inside the function with a keyword global and is therefore
    considered global. f is defined with a keyword nonlocal, which still doesn’t make
    a variable global. You can easily prove it by executing this code and then trying
    to print all the variables – only a, b and e can be printed without errors, the
    others will raise NameError.</html>
